# Problems in Ground-Based Transit

**Red Lights**  
Red lights force vehicles to idle even when no cross-traffic exists. This is a time tax paid for the failure of real-time coordination. It’s a relic of a static, centralized system.

**Lane Merging**  
Merging multi-lane highways into fewer lanes creates unnecessary bottlenecks. It’s not scalable, not safe, and it forces aggressive driver behavior.

**Collision Risk**  
Ground transport is inherently vulnerable to crashes. Human reaction time, visibility limits, and physical congestion lead to millions of preventable accidents annually.

**Air-Based Routing**  
Our vehicles bypass gridlock by operating in three dimensions. There is no merging — just adaptive routing.

**Autonomous Coordination**  
High-altitude autopilot and inter-vehicle coordination remove the need for stop-and-go traffic logic.

**Fail-Safe Architecture**  
Redundant lift systems, buoyant fallback design, and real-time terrain analysis enable near-zero crash probability.

ptarot vehicles are not cars that fly. They are a redefinition of what it means to move — and to live.
