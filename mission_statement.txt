# ptarot: The Future of Flight

**ptarot** is our initiative to bring flying vehicles to everyone — not just as a luxury, but as a scalable, safe, and sustainable new way of living and moving.

We are building **all-electric flying vehicles** for every use case:

- **Fast 4**: Ultra-responsive racing models with vertical 0–60 acceleration — speed measured in ascent, not asphalt.
- **AeroRV**: Spacious, buoyant flyers designed for permanent or semi-permanent off-grid living — land, sea, or sky.
- **Ocean-Class Flyers**: Buoyant models optimized for marine deployment and emergency water landings.
- **Solar-Integrated**: All models incorporate solar panels for energy autonomy.
- **Infinite Altitude Ops**: High-altitude autopilot enables indefinite flight — you never have to land unless you choose to.

We are redefining transportation as a form of liberation. **ptarot** is not just flying cars — it’s airborne freedom.
