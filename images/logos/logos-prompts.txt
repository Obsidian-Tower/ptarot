Create a hyper-realistic, three-dimensional emblem inspired by a pterodactyl in mid-flight, sculpted entirely from a single emerald crystal. The badge should feature sharp, elongated triangular wings and a sleek, arrow-like beak, each surface crisply bevelled to catch light. Incorporate fine chisel marks, gemstone micro-facets, and subtle vein-like fissures to evoke a hand-crafted feel. Use a rich green spectrum—from deep forest tones in the shadows to pale teal highlights—so that the stone’s translucency and depth are visible. Illuminate the form with dramatic studio lighting: a strong key light from the upper-left casts bright highlights and deep shadows, while a gentle rim light from the lower-right edge adds separation. Place the finished gem sculpture against a matte black, slightly textured background to maximize contrast. The overall composition should read as both ancient (pterosaur fossil) and futuristic (sleek geometry), conveying airborne exploration, luxury craftsmanship, and the natural beauty of emerald.
