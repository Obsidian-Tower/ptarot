# Why ptarot Exists

The U.S. transportation system is inefficient, wasteful, and outdated. We spend hours stuck at red lights, merge unnecessarily into single lanes, and suffer avoidable traffic collisions every day.

Time lost to these inefficiencies is time stolen from people â€” and from progress.

ptarot is here to end that cycle.

We believe transportation should not be a daily source of stress and risk. It should be elegant, fast, autonomous, and alive.

Our mission: end the era of traffic. Begin the era of air.
